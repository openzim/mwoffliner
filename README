mwoffliner is a tool which allows to "dump" a Wikimedia project
(Wikipedia, Wiktionary, ...) to a local storage. It goes through all
articles of the project and write the HTML/pictures  to local files.

To use it, you need a recent version of nodejs and a POSIX system
(like GNU/Linux). You need also to install all necessary nodejs
packages with "npm install <modulename>" in this directory. You can
get the list of packages you need to install in the "MODULE VARIABLE
SECTION".

One time you have done this, you should be able to start the tool with
./mwoffliner. To configure things related to the project you want to
dump, just go to the "CUSTOM VARIABLE SECTION".
